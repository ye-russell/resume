  <h5>Senior Frontend Engineer | JavaScript Specialist</h5>
  <div class="heading-container section-container container">
    <div class="content">
      <p class="text-start">
        I have 5+ years of experience delivering enterprise-grade web applications
        for global clients across industries, collaborating with distributed teams
        from the USA to Thailand. I thrive in international environments, successfully
        coordinating with colleagues across 12-hour time zones by
        <strong>prioritizing</strong> shared working hours and ensuring effective
        communication through code reviews and urgent calls.
        <br /><br />
        As a senior engineer at EPAM Systems, I’ve led modernization initiatives for
        complex applications (Angular, React, Vue) and contributed to building
        <strong>scalable</strong> UI architectures, optimized state management, and
        accessible (NVDA-tested) experiences. I focus on clean code, performance, and
        long-term maintainability over framework preference.
        <br /><br />
        Beyond delivery, I am deeply engaged in <strong>mentoring</strong> — both
        formally within project teams and through free-to-learn frontend bootcamps,
        helping juniors and career changers grow into confident professionals.
        <br /><br />
        I also <strong>contribute</strong> to the developer community, sharing knowledge through talks
        on modern Angular and advocating for approachable, developer-friendly
        practices that lower barriers for those who find advanced frameworks
        intimidating.

      <h5>Priorities</h5>
      <p class="text-start">
        With professional experience in global enterprises and academic background
        from a British university, my top priority is delivering
        <strong>high-quality, scalable, and maintainable software</strong> that
        drives measurable value for customers worldwide.
        <br /><br />
        I focus on fostering <strong>strong engineering culture</strong> through
        mentorship, knowledge sharing, and collaboration, ensuring teams deliver
        with efficiency and excellence.
        <br /><br />
        Continuous <strong>growth and innovation</strong> remain at the core of my
        approach — from adopting new technologies when they bring real business
        impact, to maintaining customer satisfaction through clear communication
        and reliable delivery.

          <p>
            It's not a best year, but it is for me...
            <br />
            I have decided to switch to software development from my previous
            petroleum sphere. Changing the qualification - it is not an easy thing
            to do, but it took time to finally realise what path is right for you.
            <br />
            <br />
            Therefore, my purpose is to constantly obtain all needed practical
            skills for a fully professional software engineer in full-stack
            development preferably using JavaScript with modern technologies
            (React, Angular, Vue and Node).

            To succeed in the field of my interest, the following path of study
            was developed:

                  To overcome difficulties with the concepts and fundamentals of
                  CS, the next step was created by participating in the paid
                  school "nFactorial" taught by the Princeton ex-teacher Arman
                  Suleimenov. Introduction to Computer Science using Java.

                  Rolling Scopes School. Hard and self-studying school of
                  JavaScript and Front-End with the deep learning to gain all
                  needed techniques.

                  A wide international community and priceless mentorship helped
                  to solid the key practical skills. Following video was made
